				<h1>Why a wedding photographer</h1>
				<p>
					Each year I pho­to­graph ap­prox­i­mately 25 wed­dings and at the end of the sea­son I make a se­lec­tion of my fa­vorite im­ages. Choos­ing “
					<em>best ofs</em>
					” is not an easy task as I usu­ally take sev­eral frames of each mo­ment at a wed­ding, es­pe­cially when there is a lot of ac­tion. Thus I may have to nar­row down 20 im­ages to a sin­gle photo that stands out from the rest. Since my goal as a wed­ding pho­tog­ra­pher is to tell a story with pic­tures I find that each wed­ding is made up of dif­fer­ent parts and usu­ally has a be­gin­ning, mid­dle, and an end. In some ways a wed­ding is like a day long novel where ten­sions rise with the prepa­ra­tions, cli­max with the cer­e­mony, and then dis­si­pate with cock­tails and danc­ing.

				<h1>Telling a story with photos</h1>
				<p>
					With a background in photojournalism, I love telling a story with pictures. A wedding is like a daylong story composed of many different elements that require that I be alert and always ready to snap a picture. It is also about sensing and predicting what may happen next and where. This kind of photography, like documentary photography, is very much about watching and waiting in a discrete manner. Finally, I find that wedding photography is one of the few disciplines in the field of photography where I can work like an artist and express myself in a personal way. Unlike editorial work for magazines and newspapers, couples usually enjoy letting me work freely. I think this is great because every photographer has a different way of seeing the world and it’s nice when he or she can work without too many constraints

				<h1>Destination marriages</h1>
				<p>
					I hope you enjoy browsing through my wedding and engagement photography website. I am based in Paris but often travel to shoot weddings. With high-speed trains and low cost flights it’s very easy to reach places like London, Geneva, Switzerland, the French Riviera or even Morocco. Should you be organizing your wedding in Paris I could also recommend a number of vendors whom I know do a great job. Should you have any questions don’t hesitate to send me an email or give me a ring. I would be more than happy to discuss your wedding day in more detail.
